#### ⚠️ PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY

**1. Authentication State Detection:**
- ⚠️ Authenticated state header testing inconclusive
- ⚠️ Dashboard button state change not clearly verified
- ⚠️ May require session management improvements

### Technical Analysis

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- ✅ Backend component editor API working correctly
- ✅ Block type definitions implemented properly in ContentBlocks.js
- ✅ GlobalHeader.js has proper block rendering logic for all three new types
- ❌ **Issue**: Disconnect between component editor saves and public header rendering
- ❌ **Possible causes**: 
  - API endpoint mismatch between editor and public rendering
  - Caching issues preventing updated blocks from appearing
  - Block data not persisting correctly to database
  - Public API not returning updated block configuration

**Frontend Implementation Verification:**
- ✅ ContentBlocks.js properly implements all three new block types (lines 114-119, 148-152, 791-905)
- ✅ GlobalHeader.js has rendering logic for logo_text, theme_toggle, and auth_buttons (lines 131-182)
- ✅ Block configuration forms working correctly in editor
- ❌ Public header API (/api/global-components/public/header) may not returning updated blocks

### Test Environment Details
- **Frontend URL:** https://fix-ui-bugs.preview.emergentagent.com
- **Authentication:** Working correctly with super admin credentials
- **Session Management:** Stable during testing operations
- **Component Editor:** Fully functional with proper UI and controls
- **Public Rendering:** Not reflecting saved changes

### Screenshots Captured
1. Header component editor with existing blocks
2. Block addition dropdown showing new block types
3. Public homepage showing old header content (not updated blocks)
4. Login page and authentication flow
5. Component editor after attempted block configuration

### Conclusion
The Header Block Components System is **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL** with a critical rendering issue:

**Status: NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX** ❌

### Issues Requiring Resolution

**CRITICAL:**
1. **Header Block Rendering**: New blocks configured in editor are not appearing on public pages - header shows old fallback content instead of CMS blocks
2. **Block Persistence**: Block deletion and addition may not be persisting correctly to the database
3. **API Integration**: Disconnect between component editor API and public header rendering API

**MODERATE:**
1. **Block Management UI**: Existing blocks not properly detected for management operations
2. **Responsive Controls**: Device visibility toggles not appearing after block addition
3. **Drag and Drop**: Block reordering controls not accessible

### Recommendations for Main Agent

1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Debug the API integration between component editor saves and public header rendering
2. **Check Database Persistence:** Verify that block configurations are being saved to the database correctly
3. **API Endpoint Verification:** Ensure /api/global-components/public/header returns updated block data
4. **Cache Clearing:** Implement cache invalidation when header blocks are updated
5. **Error Handling:** Add better error feedback in component editor when saves fail
6. **Block Detection:** Fix block detection logic in editor for proper management operations

### What Works vs. What Doesn't

**✅ WORKING:**
- Super admin authentication and access control
- Component editor UI and navigation
- Block type definitions and configuration forms
- New block types (Logo with Text, Theme Toggle, Auth Buttons) properly implemented
- Component save functionality (UI level)

- ❌ **CRITICAL:** PricingWidget component stuck in infinite loading state
- ❌ Main pricing content (Choose Your Plan, pricing cards, billing toggle) not rendering
- ❌ Loading spinner persists indefinitely despite successful API responses
- ❌ Component fails to complete data fetch and render pricing plans

### Technical Analysis

**Root Cause Investigation:**
- ✅ Backend APIs are working correctly (all endpoints return 200 OK)
- ✅ Subscription plans data is available and properly structured
- ✅ Page structure loads (navigation, footer, SEO)
- ❌ PricingWidget component's useEffect/fetchData cycle not completing
- ❌ Possible issue with AuthContext token state causing re-renders
- ❌ Component remains in loading state despite successful API calls

**Frontend Compilation:**
- ⚠️ Previous compilation errors in HomepageBlocks.js were resolved
- ✅ Frontend service now compiling successfully
- ❌ PricingWidget component still not rendering content

### Test Environment Details
- **Frontend URL:** https://fix-ui-bugs.preview.emergentagent.com/pricing
- **Backend Status:** All APIs responding correctly (200 OK)

- **Browser Testing:** Automated testing with Playwright (multiple attempts)

### Screenshots Captured
1. Pricing page with navigation and footer loaded
2. Persistent loading spinner in main content area
3. Debug screenshots showing stuck loading state

### Conclusion
The CMS-powered pricing page infrastructure is **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL** but has a critical issue:

**Status: NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX** ❌

### Issues Requiring Resolution

**CRITICAL:**
1. **PricingWidget Loading Issue:** The main pricing content component is stuck in a loading state and never renders the actual pricing plans, billing toggle, or subscription buttons.

**Root Cause:** The PricingWidget component's data fetching mechanism is not completing properly, despite backend APIs working correctly.

### Recommendations for Main Agent

1. **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** Debug the PricingWidget component's useEffect and fetchData logic
2. **Check AuthContext:** Investigate if token state changes are causing infinite re-renders
3. **Add Error Handling:** Implement better error boundaries and loading state management
4. **Consider Fallback:** Add timeout mechanism to prevent infinite loading states
5. **Test Component Isolation:** Test PricingWidget component independently to isolate the issue

### What Works vs. What Doesn't

**✅ WORKING:**
- Page routing and CMS integration
- Navigation and footer
- Backend API endpoints
- SEO implementation
- Page structure and styling

**❌ NOT WORKING:**
- PricingWidget component rendering
- Pricing plans display
- Monthly/Yearly billing toggle
- Discount code functionality
- Subscribe buttons
- All dynamic pricing features

## Orchestrator Runtime Integration Tests

### Test Scope
- Orchestration runtime wired into widget message flow
- Mother agent delegation based on child agent capabilities
- Audit log creation for orchestration runs

### Test Instructions for Testing Agent

**Test Setup:**
1. Orchestration is enabled for the tenant (andre@humanweb.no)
2. Mother agent: "Aida" (cb4928cf-907c-4ee5-8f3e-13b94334d36f) using gpt-5.1
3. Child agent: "Restaurant & Hospitality Agent" (54dee30e-3c3f-496d-8a79-79747ef6dc1c) with tags: restaurant, reservations, hospitality

**Test the Widget Chat Flow:**
1. Create a widget session for tenant
2. Send a message that should trigger orchestration
3. Check if orchestration runs are logged

**API Flow:**
1. POST /api/widget/session - Create session
   - Body: `{"tenant_id": "<tenant_id>"}`
   - Returns: session_token, conversation_id

2. POST /api/widget/messages/{conversation_id}?token={session_token}
   - Body: `{"content": "I want to make a restaurant reservation"}`
   - Should trigger orchestration since "restaurant" matches child agent tags

3. GET /api/settings/orchestration/runs - Check audit logs
   - Should show new orchestration run entries

**Expected Behavior:**
- The Mother agent analyzes the user message
- If it matches child agent tags, it delegates to the child
- Response is generated and returned to the user
- Orchestration run is logged in the audit collection
