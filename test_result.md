ALL TEST SCENARIOS PASSED (5/5 - 100% SUCCESS RATE): 1) ✅ Login and Navigation - Successfully logged in and navigated to /dashboard/messaging, general channel accessible and functional, 2) ✅ Name Mention Without @ Symbol - Verified agents 'Kaia' and 'Caire' respond to name mentions without @ symbol (e.g., 'Hi Kaia!'), agents detected and responded within 5-10 seconds as specified, 3) ✅ Multiple Agents Mentioned - Tested 'Hey Kaia and Caire, how are you both?' and verified BOTH agents respond appropriately, multiple agent coordination working correctly, 4) ✅ Collaborative Discussion - Tested 'Kaia and Caire, together come up with 3 creative names for a pet store app' and observed 30-40 second collaborative discussion with multiple back-and-forth messages between agents, agents working together to provide comprehensive responses, 5) ✅ Human-like Responses - Verified responses use natural language with emojis (😊, 🤔), contractions (I'm, don't, we've), casual phrases (Good point, I think, What about), and varied response lengths. CRITICAL VERIFICATION: Multi-agent collaboration system working perfectly with intelligent name detection, proactive responses, collaborative discussion mode, and human-like behavior variations. Agents respond naturally without requiring @ symbols, coordinate effectively when multiple agents are mentioned, and engage in meaningful collaborative discussions. The messaging system successfully supports advanced multi-agent interactions as specified in the review request."

        comment: "✅ MESSAGING API DEBUGGING COMPLETED: Comprehensive backend API testing performed with credentials andre@humanweb.no/Pernilla66! to debug 'Failed to send message' error. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Backend API expects query parameters, not JSON body. RESULTS: 1) ✅ Query Parameters Method - POST /api/messaging/messages?content=...&channel_id=... works perfectly (200 OK), message sent successfully with ID 0adc0a7a-7fe2-4c4b-bf24-e750455607a0, 2) ❌ JSON Body Method - POST /api/messaging/messages with JSON body fails (422 Unprocessable Entity), error: 'Field required', 'loc': ['query', 'content'], 3) ❌ Form Data Method - Same 422 error as JSON body. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: Backend endpoint signature expects all parameters as query parameters (content: str, channel_id: Optional[str] = None), not as request body. Frontend axios.post(`${API}/api/messaging/messages`, null, { params: {...}, headers }) format is CORRECT and working. CONCLUSION: Backend API is working correctly, frontend implementation is correct, no bug exists. The 'Failed to send message' error must be caused by frontend validation, network issues, or CORS problems, not the backend API itself. All messaging endpoints tested successfully: channels list (1 channel found), channel details, message retrieval (6 messages), users list (8 users), unread counts (0). Backend logs confirm successful message sending with query parameters."

Despite successful document upload (test document with ACME Corp info uploaded, 1 chunk processed), the agent answers general knowledge questions like 'What is the capital of France?' with 'The capital of France is Paris' instead of refusing.

## Company-Level Mother Agent Feature Test (2025-12-24)
**Testing Agent**: Main Agent  
**Test Focus**: Company-Level Mother Agent implementation for Orchestration

### ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

#### Backend Changes
1. **models/orchestration.py**
   - Added `mother_user_agent_id` field to `OrchestrationConfig` model
   - Added `mother_user_agent_id` field to `OrchestrationConfigUpdate` model
   - Added `mother_agent_type` field to `OrchestrationStatusResponse` model

2. **server.py - GET /api/settings/orchestration**
   - Updated to check for company-level mother agent first (priority)
   - Falls back to admin-level mother agent if no company agent selected
   - Returns `mother_agent_type` field ('admin' or 'company')

3. **server.py - PUT /api/settings/orchestration**
   - Added validation for `mother_user_agent_id` (company agents)
   - Validates that company agent belongs to the tenant

4. **server.py - generate_ai_response**
   - Updated to check for either admin or company-level mother agent

5. **services/orchestrator.py**
   - Updated `initialize()` to load either admin or company mother agent
   - Company-level agent takes priority over admin-level
   - Added `mother_agent_type` tracking
   - Updated audit log to track which type of mother agent was used

#### Frontend (Already Implemented)
- OrchestrationSettings.js correctly displays both company and admin agents
- Selecting company agent sends `mother_user_agent_id`
- Selecting admin agent sends `mother_admin_agent_id`
- UI shows correct badge ("Company Agent" vs "Admin Agent")

### 🧪 TEST RESULTS

#### Test 1: Select Company Agent as Mother
- **Action**: Clicked "E-commerce Support Agent" 
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Verification**: API returns `mother_agent_type: "company"`

#### Test 2: Switch Back to Admin Agent
- **Action**: Clicked "Aida" admin agent
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Verification**: API returns `mother_agent_type: "admin"`

#### Test 3: API Response Structure
- **Endpoint**: GET /api/settings/orchestration
- **New Fields**: `mother_agent_type`, `allowed_child_agent_ids`
- **Result**: ✅ All fields returned correctly

### 📊 FEATURE STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Companies can now select their own agents as "Mother Agents" for orchestration, giving them full autonomy over their multi-agent orchestration setup without depending on system-wide admin agents.

## Avatar Display Bug Fix Test (2025-12-27)
**Testing Agent**: Backend and Frontend Testing Agent
**Test Environment**: Production (https://slack-clone-fix.preview.emergentagent.com)
**Login Credentials**: andre@humanweb.no / Pernilla66!
**Test Focus**: Verify user and agent avatar images display correctly across the messaging UI

### Issue Description
User and agent avatars were showing fallbacks or generic icons instead of actual profile images due to field name mismatch:
- Database stores: `avatar_url` for both users and agents
- Backend was querying for: `profile_image_url` (non-existent field)
- Frontend was using: `profile_image_url` for agents

### Fix Applied
1. Updated `/app/backend/routes/messaging.py` to query `avatar_url` instead of `profile_image_url` for agents
2. Updated `/app/frontend/src/pages/Messaging.js` to use `avatar_url` for agents

### Test Scenarios to Verify
1. ✅ User avatars in message items
2. ✅ Agent avatars in message items  
3. ✅ Avatars in DM list sidebar
4. ✅ Overlapping avatars in channel header
5. ✅ Avatars in Channel Settings modal
6. ✅ Avatars in New Message modal
7. ✅ Current user avatar at bottom of sidebar

### Status: ✅ VERIFIED - ALL TESTS PASSED
